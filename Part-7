1. Creating and Managing Branches

Q. Explain the concept of branches in Git.
Ans. A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository's history. It enables developers to work on different lines of development independently. Each branch represents an independent line of development that starts from a certain point and can diverge from the main codebase.

Q.How to create, list, and switch branches.
Ans.
Create : git branch <branch-name>
